"""## Section 1: Introduction to Probability

### What Probability Theory Is!

### Here below is a quick review of probability and Combinatorial. Go through carefully and pick a leaf to answer the questions at the end

#### Events and Sample Spaces

Let's assume we have a fair coin, which is equally likely to come up heads (H) or tails (T).

In instances like this, where the two outcomes are equally likely, we can use probability theory to express the likelihood of a particular **event** by comparing it with the **sample space** (the set of all possible outcomes; can be denoted as $\Omega$):

$$ P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{# of outcomes of event}}{\text{# of outcomes in }\Omega} $$

If we're only flipping the coin once, then there are only two possible outcomes in the sample space $\Omega$: it will either be H or T (using set notation, we could write this as $\Omega$ = {H, T}).

Therefore: $$ P(H) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$

Equally: $$ P(T) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$

As a separate example, consider drawing a single card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. In this case, the number of possible outcomes in the sample space $\Omega$ is 52.

There is only one ace of spades in the deck, so the probability of drawing it is: $$ P(\text{ace of spades}) = \frac{1}{52} \approx 0.019 $$

In contrast there are four aces, so the probability of drawing an ace is: $$ P(\text{ace}) = \frac{4}{52} \approx 0.077 $$

Some additional examples: 
$$ P(\text{spade}) = \frac{13}{52} = 0.25 $$
$$ P(\text{ace OR spade}) = \frac{16}{52} \approx 0.307 $$
$$ P(\text{card}) = \frac{52}{52} = 1 $$
$$ P(\text{turnip}) = \frac{0}{52} = 0 $$

#### Multiple Independent Observations

Let's return to coin flipping to illustrate situations where we have an event consisting of multiple independent observations. For example, the probability of throwing two consecutive heads is: $$ P(\text{HH}) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$ ...because there is one HH event in the sample set of four possible events ($\Omega$ = {HH, HT, TH, TT}).

Likewise, the probability of throwing *three* consecutive heads is: $$ P(\text{HHH}) = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 $$ ...because there is one HHH event in the sample set of eight possible events ($\Omega$ = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}).

As final examples, the probability of throwing exactly two heads in three tosses is $ P = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375 $ while the probability of throwing at least two heads in three tosses is $ P = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 $.

#### Combining Probabilities

In order to combine probabilities, we can multiply them. So the probability of throwing five consecutive heads, for example, is the product of probabilities we've already calculated: $$ P(\text{HHHHH}) = P(\text{HH}) \times P(\text{HHH}) = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{32} \approx 0.031 $$

#### Combinatorics

*Combinatorics* is a field of mathematics devoted to counting that can be helpful to studying probabilities. We can use **factorials** (e.g., $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$), which feature prominently in combinatorics, to calculate probabilities instead of painstakingly determining all of the members of the sample space $\Omega$ and counting subsets within $\Omega$.

More specifically, we can calculate the number of outcomes of an event using the "number of combinations" equation: $$ {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} $$

The left-hand side of the equation is read "$n$ choose $k$" and is most quickly understood via an example: If we have three coin flips, $n = 3$, and if we're interested in the number of ways to get two head flips (or two tail flips, for that matter), $k = 2$. We would read this as "3 choose 2" and calculate it as:
$$ {n \choose k} = {3 \choose 2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{3!}{(2!)(1!)} = \frac{3 \times 2 \times 1}{(2 \times 1)(1)} = \frac{6}{(2)(1)} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 $$

This provide us with the numerator for event-probability equation from above: $$ P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{# of outcomes of event}}{\text{# of outcomes in }\Omega} $$

In the case of coin-flipping (or any binary process with equally probable outcomes), the denominator can be calculated with $2^n$ (where $n$ is again the number of coin flips), so: $$ \frac{\text{# of outcomes of event}}{\text{# of outcomes in }\Omega} = \frac{3}{2^n} = \frac{3}{2^3} = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375 $$

## Section 2: Attemppt at least 4 Questions from this section

### Question 2: Moments of Probability : Expected Value

**Exercises**:

1. Assuming heads = 1 and tails = 0, whatâ€™s the expected value of the toss of a fair coin? 
2. ...and of two tosses of a fair coin? 
3. You are one of a thousand people to purchase a lottery ticket. The ticket costs \\$10 and pays out \\$5000. What value should you expect from this transaction?

### Question 3: Probability Distributions

### a). Binomial Distribution

All distributions so far have been for continuous variables (PDFs). This one is discrete (PMF). 

We've already been using it for coin flips; it's used for binary (0 or 1) outcome. 

Its parameters are: 

* *n*: number of trials
* *p*: probability of outcome of 1
* *size*: number of experiments with *n* trials each

"""## c). Gaussian or Normal Distribution

Gaussian or Normal distribution is a **standard normal distribution** (a.k.a., standard Gaussian distribution). Normal distributions can be denoted with the *math calligraphy* font as $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, thus the standard normal distribution can be denoted as $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. 

(N.B.: $\sigma^2 = \sigma$ in this case because $1^2 = 1$.)

Normal distributions are by far the most common distribution in statistics and machine learning. They are typically the default option, particularly if you have limited information about the random process you're modeling, because: 

1. Normal distributions assume the greatest possible uncertainty about the random variable they represent (relative to any other distribution of equivalent variance). Details of this are beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
2. Simple and very complex random processes alike are, under all common conditions, normally distributed when we sample values from the process. Since we sample data for statistical and machine learning models alike, this so-called **central limit theorem** (covered next) is a critically important concept.
